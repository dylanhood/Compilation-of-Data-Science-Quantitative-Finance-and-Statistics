Compilation of Data Science, Quantitative Finance, and Statistics
<br></br>
<br></br>
I know / I'm aware - got it got it got it
<br></br>
I know what you're thinking "Dude, where's all the explanatory information and implementations of options, futures, VaR, risk, Monte Carlo, Modern Portfolio Theory, Probabilistic Sharpe Ratios, bonds, securities, financial analysis, statistical analysis, derivatives, etc.?"
<div>&nbsp;</div>
Just give me a minute (my dude - you act like I'm getting paid quant/FAANG-level stacks to do this [if I was then you'd probably have all of it by now]).
<br></br>
<br></br>
<b>Don't Hate Me:</b> I got other stuff to do, as well (fix my portfolio website, finish the first version of my quantracer web application, university classes, somehow securing a nice internship for the summer and/or fall of 2023, etc.)
<br></br>
Just click the watch button at the top right and wait for the updates (go touch grass bro)
<br></br>
<br></br>
And yes I'm aware of how unprofessional this README.md file is.
